# NoJumpDelay
Open-source copy of the NoJumpDelay mod, updated to the newest version of Minecraft.

[NoJumpDelay](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-jump-delay) is a fabric mod that removes the delay when jumping by spamming the jump input when spacebar is held. Originally made by Flowng and published to Modrinth, no source was provided, and it was not updated past 1.20.2.

I took it upon myself to decompile the 1.20.2 copy and update it to 1.20.4+; While I initially intended to only update the mod, I also found that the entire structure was a mess, with references to an older mod ID, and even an older (different) mod.

So, here it is now: No Jump Delay, open-sourced, updated, and at least *trying* to follow proper development guidelines. Enjoy :D

# License & Credit
The original mod used the MIT license, so I used that here as well. Similarly, as the original mod was made by Flowng, I credited them in the [`fabric.mod.json`](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/NoJumpDelay/blob/main/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json).
